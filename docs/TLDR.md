What does the toolkit do and why is it useful?  The core value proposition of the toolkit is:
	* Collect accessibility needs from users into ability profiles 
	* The toolkit provides example surfaces (web, xr, mobile) that render needs per platform, example platform bindings, and a catalog of web adapters — all of which a developer can use or override
	* Provides the model, recipes, and catalog that the developer's interface layer consumes

tl;dr: The toolkit understands the person and decides what should change; the developer's app renders and applies it

Developer flow:
* A developer implements a different repository with their application in it.
* That repository links into the toolkit in a local directory ...  OR uses the toolkit in [server mode](https://github.com/anoopsinha/AI-for-Accessibility-Toolkit-Draft/tree/rearch-experiment/server).
* The developer's task is to use the toolkit and create the interface layer that makes the application accessible for users across ability profiles

Disabled user's experience in an app that uses the toolkit
* A user with any specific needs should be able to come to the app
* They should request what type of support that they need.  The toolkit will capture that need.
* The toolkit figures out what adaptations serve the need (learning + skill-building, with consent), and hands the host a deterministic settings plan; the host orchestrates applying that layer on top of the app.

tldr:
Capture a person's accessibility needs as a portable, consent-gated ability model; use an agent to turn plain-language needs into reusable skill recipes grounded in a catalog of fixes; and resolve those, deterministically, into a settings plan the developer's app applies — the same understanding rendering natively across web, XR, and mobile surfaces.
